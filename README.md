# Project_Khmer_detection

**Overview**  
Project_Khmer_detection focuses on training a YOLOv11 model for detecting Khmer script. The training process has been conducted using two configurations: 50 epochs and 80 epochs, to evaluate and compare the model's performance.

**Features**  
- Utilizes the advanced YOLOv11 architecture for object detection.
- Trained on Khmer script data to achieve high accuracy in script detection tasks.
- Supports training configurations for flexible epoch settings.

**Getting Started**  
Clone the repository and follow the setup instructions to reproduce the training process or adapt it for your custom dataset.
- Change part in yaml file
